# python-mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects I built while learning and practising programming. Each project is stored in its own folder and includes a self-contained script.

Projects include:
- Dice Roller: A simple program that lets the user roll any number of dice, each with a chosen number of sides.
- Number Guessing Game: A simple console-based game where the player tries to guess a random number.
- Password Generator: A program that generates secure passwords of a chosen length (containing at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character). It can also store and display existing passwords.
- To-Do List: A simple task tracker that allows users to add, view, and save their to-do items.

Run any project by opening its folder and executing the Python file.

Purpose of This Repository - To demonstrate:
- Basic Python problem-solving skills
- Use of standard libraries
- Logical thinking and programming fundamentals
