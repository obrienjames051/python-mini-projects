# python-mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects I built while learning and practicing programming. Each project is stored in its own folder and includes a self-contained script.

Projects include:
- Number Guessing Game: A simple console-based game where the player tries to guess a random number.

Run any project by opening its folder and executing the Python file.

Purpose of This Repository - To demonstrate:
- Basic Python problem-solving skills
- Use of standard libraries
- Logical thinking and programming fundamentals
